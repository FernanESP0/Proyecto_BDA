# requirements.txt
# Generated: 2025-10-21 (updated)
# Third-party dependencies required by the ETL/DW scripts in this repository.
# Version ranges are intentionally permissive; pin exact versions in CI for
# reproducible builds (e.g. `pip freeze > requirements-frozen.txt`).

# Core data processing
pandas>=1.5,<3
numpy>=1.24,<2

# Database adapters and analytical engines
psycopg2-binary>=2.9,<3
duckdb>=0.8.1,<1

# ETL framework used in the code
pygrametl>=3.8,<4

# Utilities
tqdm>=4.65,<5
tabulate>=0.9,<1

# Notes
# - Standard library modules (os, sys, time, pathlib, logging, datetime, calendar, decimal,
#   typing, warnings, etc.) are intentionally omitted.
# - If you want reproducible installs in CI or production, pin exact versions in a
#   separate `requirements-frozen.txt` produced after validating the environment.
# - Editor/type-checker: the code uses `# type:ignore` on imports lacking stubs
#   (for example `tabulate`). If you use mypy/pyright and need stricter checks,
#   add appropriate type stubs or suppressions to your config.
