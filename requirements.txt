# requirements.txt
# Generated: 2025-10-21
# This file lists the third-party Python packages used across the project .py files.
# The versions below are conservative constraints (lower-bound compatible ranges).
# Adjust pins to match your deployment/CI environment or the versions installed in your virtualenv.

# Core data processing
pandas>=1.5,<3
numpy>=1.24,<2

# Database adapters and OLAP
psycopg2-binary>=2.9,<3
duckdb>=0.8.1,<1

# ETL framework used in the code
pygrametl>=3.8,<4

# Utilities
tqdm>=4.65,<5
tabulate>=0.9,<1

# Notes:
# - Standard-library modules (time, os, sys, pathlib, logging, datetime, calendar, decimal, typing, warnings)
#   are intentionally omitted.
# - Some projects prefer exact pins (==); here we use ranges to avoid conflicts. If you need repeatable
#   builds, convert to exact pins after confirming the working environment (e.g. pip freeze > requirements.txt).
# - Type stubs: your editor complained about missing stubs for 'tabulate'. There is no widely-used
#   'types-tabulate' package as of generation. The source already uses "# type:ignore" for that import
#   (see `query_test.py`), which is a practical workaround for Pyright/mypy.
